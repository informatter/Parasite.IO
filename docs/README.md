# Parasite.IO
Parasite.IO is a work in progress Interoperability application that attempts to seamlessly transfer *data* between different CAD or gaming  applications. 
The Data will eventually be passed around via a Web API using typical RESTFUL calls to operate and receive data. 
At the moment I am adding functionality to exchange information between Grasshopper and Dynamo. 
This application can be easily embedded in any other .NET development environment and with additional work to other frameworks which font support .NET such as the Unreal Engine. 

This repo is still not clonable ready, but the skin and bones will be ready soon.
